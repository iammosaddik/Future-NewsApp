With our newest Amazon Fresh store, we are taking the next step on our path to becoming a net-zero carbon business by 2040, and we welcome customers to experience this firsthand while shopping with us in this store.”<br>Some upgrades will be used at all of our Amazon Fresh grocery stores moving forward, such as lower-carbon concrete flooring, which will help to reduce our embodied carbon.<br><br>“In order to deliver on our commitments to The Climate Pledge, we must work together across all areas of our business to develop solutions to decarbonize,” said Kara Hurst, vice president of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon. “It’s meaningful progress to open our latest Amazon Fresh Store seeking net-zero carbon certification, and I’m proud of the innovation and technology that the store offers to customers and employees, and for the environment.”</span>","image":["http://maannews.maantechnology.com/public/uploads/images/newsimages/maannewsimage23102021_072605_amazon.jpg"],"date":"2021-11-03","news_subcategory":"Movies","news_category":"Entertainment","news_categoryslug":"entertainment-news","reporter_name":"Reporter 21"},{"id":43,"title":"Green-party success Is reshaping global politics are increasingly shaping the debate in countries around the world","summary":"The British-Iranian dual national, who was detained for six years in Iran, said she should have been back in the UK “six years ago”.","description":"<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(4, 40, 74); margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 19px; list-style: none; line-height: 24.5px; position: relative;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 38, 74); font-family: Poppins; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;\">The\r\n British-Iranian dual national, who was detained for six years in Iran, \r\nsaid she should have been back in the UK “six years ago”.<br><br>Speaking\r\n in parliament on Monday at her first press conference, she said she did\r\n “not really agree” that she should be thanking the foreign secretary \r\nfor her return.<br><br>“I have seen five foreign secretary changes over \r\nthe course of six years.

Senator Kamala Harris of California became the \r\nnation’s first African American woman nominated for the vice presidency \r\nof the United States. It is a moment to be savored, a time to reflect, \r\nand a new journey to begin. Shirley Chisholm was the first African \r\nAmerican woman elected to Congress, and the first Black major party \r\ncandidate to run for president of the United States. In 1972 she said, \r\n“at present, our country needs women’s idealism and determination, \r\nperhaps more in politics than anywhere else.” The historicity of this \r\nhour reminds us again of that idealism, determination, and authentic \r\nsensitivity we often find in women. It just seems to be a part of who \r\nthey are. It often appears in the way they govern. There is an undying \r\nbelief on the part of women, expressed in the words of former \r\npresidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, “we are agents of change,\r\n we are drivers of progress, we are makers of peace – all we need is a \r\nfighting chance.” This is a bold move on the part of Vice President Joe \r\nBiden. It is another opportunity for our nation to move a little closer \r\ntowards a more perfect union. It is a union for which Dr. Martin Luther \r\nKing, Jr., said, “one day we will judge people not by the color of their\r\n skin but by the content of their character.” While the NAACP does not \r\nendorse candidates, we are compelled to recognize the historic impact of\r\n these rare moments in time. This election will really be for the very \r\nsoul of our nation. As the author James Cone has written When My Soul \r\nLooks Back, “it wonders how I get over.” I can hear the voice of Harriet\r\n Tubman humming. I can hear Ida B. Wells declaring, Fannie Lou \r\nHamersinging, and Shirley Chisholm calling out the words of that old \r\ngospel song “he didn’t bring us this far to leave us.” It is time for \r\neveryone regardless of color, station, or vocation to Take Your Soles To\r\n The Polls. Take them by mail or directly to the voting booth. Let us \r\nVote!

In no particular order, let’s take a brief look at the \r\nlosers at Deadline Day.<br><br>1. Edmonton Oilers: They’ve been getting \r\nimproved goaltending of late, but the Oilers not too long ago were in \r\ngoalie hell with their current pair of Mikko Koskinen and Mike Smith. In\r\n Koskinen’s past two games, he’s put in sub-.900 save percentages, and \r\nin two of his past five appearances, Smith has posted a sub.860 SP.<br><br>Did\r\n Edmonton GM Ken Holland have all the reason in the world to go out and \r\nget a better goalie? He sure did. Could that failure to do so come back \r\nto haunt him once the playoffs begin? It sure could. Holland had all \r\nseason long to find another netminder, and he knew the deadline was \r\ncoming. It didn’t have to come to this, but now, it has. A goaltending \r\ncrisis may prove to be what sinks the Oilers’ championship aspirations.<br>2.\r\n Toronto Maple Leafs: The Leafs land here with a caveat – namely, the \r\nacknowledgment that Toronto GM Kyle Dubas did improve his blueline and \r\nfourth line of forwards when he acquired D-man Mark Giordano and forward\r\n Colin Blackwell from Seattle on Sunday. However, their most pressing \r\nneed – a veteran goalie to be given a shot at the No. 1 job until Jack \r\nCampbell returns from a rib injury – was not dealt with by the deadline.<br><br>That\r\n means, if rookie netminder Erik Kallgren crumbles under the pressure of\r\n the starter’s role, Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe will have no other \r\nalternative but to use Petr Mrazek. And anyone who has watched Mrazek’s \r\nrecent games will tell you that’s not a good thing. Mrazek’s .884 SP and\r\n 3.48 goals-against average show his struggles with Toronto this season,\r\n and the pressure is only going to increase on him, whenever the Leafs \r\ndecide to play him. Another soft goal here or there and Mrazek will be \r\nquickly pulled from games.<br><br>Dubas has claimed he waived Mrazek \r\nover the weekend as a salary cap move, but who’s kidding who - you don’t\r\n waive someone you really want to keep around. If, for whatever reason, \r\nanother franchise decided to take a chance on Mrazek – for this year, \r\nand two more years, with a $3.8 million annual cap hit – there would be \r\nlittle in the way of mourning over Mrazek’s departure. Instead, Leafs \r\nbrass now has to be cold-blooded in their analysis and deployment of \r\ngoalies. Campbell and Kallgren will get the first chances to run with \r\nthe No. 1 job, and if they fail, it will fall on Mrazek to get one last \r\nshot at proving himself in Toronto.</span>","image":["http://maannews.maantechnology.com/public/uploads/images/newsimages/maannewsimage19102021_120026_44-445587_stage-photos-hd.jpg"],"date":"2021-10-20","news_subcategory":"Movies","news_category":"Entertainment","news_categoryslug":"entertainment-news","reporter_name":"Reporter 21"}],"first_page_url":"http://maannews.maantechnology.com/api/category_news/5?page=1","from":1,"last_page":1,"last_page_url":"http://maannews.maantechnology.com/api/category_news/5?page=1","links":[{"url":null,"label":"&laquo; Previous","active":false},{"url":"http://maannews.maantechnology.com/api/category_news/5?page=1","label":"1","active":true},{"url":null,"label":"Next &raquo;","active":false}],"next_page_url":null,"path":"http://maannews.maantechnology.com/api/category_news/5","per_page":10,"prev_page_url":null,"to":9,"total":9}
